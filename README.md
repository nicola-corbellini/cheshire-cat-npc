# Unity3D NPC with the Cheshire Cat AI framework

This is an experiment to interface the [Cheshire Cat](https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat) AI framework with Unity3D.  
The code is described in two Medium articles.

this part focuses on the Cat framework. It briefly explains the architecture and how to customize the NPC backend.


- **[New game experiences with Unity3D and the Cheshire Cat — pt. 2](https://medium.com/mad-chatter-tea-party/new-game-experiences-with-unity3d-and-the-cheshire-cat-pt-2-a4d11a90d327)**:
this part focuses on setting up Unity to interface with the Cat backend and how to exploit the incoming messages to trigger some predefined animations of a free asset.

Any feedback or comment is much appreciated.
